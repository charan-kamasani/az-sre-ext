# Portal and CLI handoff guide

Some Azure SRE Agent setup steps work with `az sre`, some work only in the portal, and some
need the portal first and the CLI after. This guide goes through each official Microsoft Learn
quickstart and tutorial step by step and tells you which to use, with the exact command or the
exact portal page.

Start with [Step 4: Set up incident response](#step-4-set-up-incident-response), a complete
worked example.

Checked on 2026-11-10 against the Learn pages linked below, the page routes in the portal's own
code and this extension. Learn pages change often. If a step here no longer matches its
tutorial, [open an issue](https://github.com/charan-kamasani/az-sre-ext/issues).

## How to read this guide

Each tutorial step has one of these labels:

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| CLI | A terminal command does the whole step: `az sre`, another `az` command, or a REST call the tutorial gives. The command is shown. |
| Portal | Only the portal can do this step. The portal page is shown. |
| Portal, then CLI | Start in the portal, then finish with the commands shown. |
| CLI, then portal | Run the command, then finish in the portal, usually to sign in or to set something the CLI can't. |
| External | The step happens in another service, such as GitHub, PagerDuty or Azure DevOps. |

Steps in the agent's chat, such as asking a question, approving an action or watching an
investigation, are Portal steps: `az sre` has no chat command. Parts of a tutorial that only
describe behavior are left out.

Set these variables once. The commands below use them:

```bash
SUBSCRIPTION_ID="$(az account show --query id -o tsv)"
RG="rg-sre-demo"
AGENT="sre-demo"
PORTAL="https://sre.azure.com/agents/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RG/providers/Microsoft.App/agents/$AGENT"
```

Commands run in your active subscription. Add `--subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID"` to choose
another one. The examples use bash. For PowerShell, see
[JSON quoting on Windows](operations.md#windows-powershell-json-quoting).

## Portal pages

Each page of an agent in the portal has its own URL: `$PORTAL` followed by the path in this
table. For example, this prints the link to the agent's response plans:

```bash
echo "$PORTAL/views/incidents/triggersAndResponsePlans"
```

Write `resourceGroups` exactly like that, with a capital G: the portal reads the agent's
resource ID from the URL case-sensitively.

| Page | Portal menu | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent home and chat | Select the agent | None |
| New chat | New chat | `/views/thread/new` |
| Incidents, including Connect an incident platform | Incidents | `/views/incidents` |
| Triggers & response plans | Incidents > Triggers & response plans | `/views/incidents/triggersAndResponsePlans` |
| Scheduled tasks and HTTP triggers | Automation | `/views/automation` |
| Agent Canvas | Build + setup > Workflows > Agent Canvas | `/views/workflows/subAgentBuilder` |
| Code access | Build + setup > Context > Code access | `/views/context/codeAccess` |
| Knowledge sources | Build + setup > Context > Knowledge sources | `/views/context/knowledgeSources` |
| Managed resources | Build + setup > Context > Managed resources | `/views/context/managedResourcesGroups` |
| Connectors | Build + setup > Extensions > Connectors | `/views/extensions/connectors` |
| Tools | Build + setup > Extensions > Tools | `/views/extensions/tools` |
| Skills | Build + setup > Extensions > Skills | `/views/extensions/skills` |
| Skill builder | Build + setup > Extensions > Skill builder | `/views/extensions/skillBuilder` |
| Plugins | Build + setup > Extensions > Plugins | `/views/extensions/plugins` |
| Hooks | Build + setup > Extensions > Hooks | `/views/extensions/globalHooks` |
| Custom instructions | Build + setup > Extensions > Custom instructions | `/views/extensions/customInstructions` |
| Session insights | Build + setup > Monitor > Session insights | `/views/monitor/sessionInsights` |
| Agent consumption | Build + setup > Monitor > Agent consumption | `/views/monitor/agentConsumption` |
| General settings | Settings > General | `/views/settings/general` |

To create an agent in the portal, go to [sre.azure.com](https://sre.azure.com) and select
**Create agent**.

Some Learn pages use older menu names: Builder for Build + setup, Capabilities for Extensions
and Activities > Incidents for Incidents. The older paths still work. For example,
`/views/builder/incidentPlatform` opens the Incidents page.

The paths come from the portal's route table as of 2026-11-10. If one stops working, use the
menu.

## What the CLI does differently

The portal does some setup for you that `az sre` doesn't. These differences decide several of
the labels below.

- **Your role on the agent.** The portal's Create agent wizard makes you SRE Agent
  Administrator on the new agent. `az sre agent create` does that only when you pass
  `--grant-access-to-me admin`. As in the portal, creating the agent and that role assignment
  needs Owner, or Contributor plus User Access Administrator. Without an SRE Agent role,
  commands that call the agent's own API fail with
  `Forbidden(Forbidden: Access denied by PDP)`, even for a subscription Owner. To give yourself
  the role later:

  ```bash
  az sre access grant -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" --role admin --assignee-me
  ```

  A new role assignment took 10 to 30 seconds to apply in testing.
- **The incident platform.** Learn says Azure Monitor connects automatically when you create an
  agent in the portal. An agent created with `az sre agent create` has no incident platform,
  and `az sre response-plan create` fails until one is set. See
  [Connect your incident platform](#connect-your-incident-platform).
- **The agent's identities.** The portal's wizard sets the agent's knowledge-graph and action
  identities (`properties.knowledgeGraphConfiguration.identity` and
  `properties.actionConfiguration.identity`) to the user-assigned identity it creates.
  `az sre agent create` also creates a user-assigned identity, but sets neither unless you pass
  `--knowledge-graph-configuration` and `--action-configuration`.
- **Azure resource access.** When you add a subscription, resource group or management group,
  the portal assigns roles to the agent's identity and also adds the scope to the agent's
  managed resources (`properties.knowledgeGraphConfiguration.managedResources`).
  `az sre managed-resource grant` assigns Reader and Monitoring Contributor but doesn't add the
  scope, so the scope doesn't appear on the portal's Managed resources page.
- **Response plans.** A plan's match rules are saved through Azure Resource Manager and its
  instructions through the agent's own API, so you need access to the agent resource and an SRE
  Agent role.

## Step 4: Set up incident response

This is the worked example for
[Step 4: Set up incident response](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sre-agent/tutorial-incident-response).
[Automate incident response](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sre-agent/automate-incidents) and
[Set up an incident trigger](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sre-agent/response-plan) cover the
same flow, and their extra fields are included here.

**Summary:** with Azure Monitor, every setup step works from the CLI except previewing matching
incidents, and you follow incidents in the portal. With PagerDuty or ServiceNow, connect the
platform in the portal, then create and manage response plans from the CLI.

The commands below were tested on a new agent on 2026-11-10.

### Prerequisites

| Step | Label | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create the agent | CLI | `az sre agent create`, see [Create and set up](#create-and-set-up). |
| Give yourself an SRE Agent role | CLI | `az sre access grant -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" --role admin --assignee-me`, then wait about 30 seconds. Skip this if you created the agent with `--grant-access-to-me admin`. |
| Create the subagent that handles incidents | CLI | `az sre subagent create`, below. |

The subagent's instructions must be at least 50 characters:

```bash
cat > incident-responder.json <<'JSON'
{
  "instructions": "You investigate Azure Monitor alerts for the checkout API. Check recent deployments, error rates and dependencies, then summarize the likely cause with evidence.",
  "handoffDescription": "Use for Azure Monitor incidents on the checkout API."
}
JSON

az sre subagent create -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" \
  --name incident-responder --value "@incident-responder.json"
```

### Connect your incident platform

| Step | Label | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Monitor | CLI | Set the platform with the commands below. |
| Azure Monitor: Monitoring Contributor for the agent's knowledge-graph identity | CLI | The portal does this when that identity is set. Agents created with `az sre agent create` don't have one. Command below. |
| PagerDuty: enter the REST API access key | Portal | Incidents > Connect an incident platform > PagerDuty (`/views/incidents`). |
| ServiceNow: enter the instance URL and credentials | Portal | Incidents > Connect an incident platform > ServiceNow (`/views/incidents`). |
| Disconnect the current platform before you switch | Portal | Incidents, the platform's **...** menu > Disconnect. Response plans are kept. |
| Quickstart response plan option | Portal | Offered when you connect a platform in the portal. Leave it off if you manage plans from the CLI, see [Remove the quickstart plan](#remove-the-quickstart-plan). |

Set Azure Monitor as the incident platform, then check it. The second command prints
`{"type": "AzMonitor"}`:

```bash
az sre agent update -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" \
  --incident-management-configuration "{type:AzMonitor}"

az sre agent show -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" \
  --query properties.incidentManagementConfiguration
```

If the agent is linked to Application Insights and `agent update` fails with
`(InvalidApplicationInsightsConfiguration) The AppId and ConnectionString fields must be provided
together.`, run it again with the `--log-configuration` you linked it with, such as
`--log-configuration "@log-configuration.json"`. Azure never returns the stored connection
string, so the CLI can't resend it for you.

When Azure Monitor is the platform, the portal also gives the agent's knowledge-graph identity
Monitoring Contributor on the agent's subscription. Check for that identity with the first
command below. On an agent created with `az sre agent create`, it prints nothing, so skip the
grant. If it prints an identity, grant the role with the second command, which assigns Reader
and Monitoring Contributor:

```bash
az sre agent show -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" \
  --query properties.knowledgeGraphConfiguration.identity -o tsv

az sre managed-resource grant -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" \
  --identity "<knowledge-graph-identity>" --target-subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
```

The PagerDuty and ServiceNow wizards save two things: the connection, on the agent resource, and
the indexing scope, through the agent's own API. The indexing scope is which PagerDuty services
or which ServiceNow assignment group the agent indexes.
`az sre agent update --incident-management-configuration` sets only the connection, so use the
portal for these two platforms. ServiceNow sign-in methods other than basic authentication,
such as OAuth 2.0, are portal-only.

### Create a response plan

| Step | Label | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent Canvas > **+** on the subagent > Add incident response plan | CLI | `az sre response-plan create`, below. |
| Name and severity levels | CLI | `--name`, `--priority` (`Sev0` to `Sev4` for Azure Monitor, `P1`, `P2` and so on for PagerDuty, `1` to `5` for ServiceNow) |
| Impacted service, incident type and title keyword | CLI | `--impacted-service`, `--incident-type`, `--title-contains` |
| Title does not contain | CLI | `--title-not-contains` |
| Response subagent | CLI | `--subagent` |
| Autonomy level, Review recommended | CLI | `--mode review`. Without it the plan is autonomous, which is also the portal's default. |
| Alert reinvestigation cooldown | CLI | `--merge-enabled true --merge-window-hours 3`. The portal allows 1 to 24 hours. |
| Instructions for the subagent | CLI | `--instructions`, `--processing-guide` |
| Preview matching incidents | Portal | Triggers & response plans (`/views/incidents/triggersAndResponsePlans`). The CLI has no preview. |
| Create | CLI | `az sre response-plan create` saves the plan. |

Route Sev0 and Sev1 Azure Monitor alerts about the checkout API to the subagent, in review mode:

```bash
az sre response-plan create -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" \
  --name sev1-checkout --platform AzMonitor --subagent incident-responder \
  --priority Sev0 Sev1 --title-contains checkout --title-not-contains test \
  --mode review --merge-enabled true --merge-window-hours 3 \
  --instructions "Check deployments from the last 24 hours before anything else."
```

An agent has one incident platform at a time, and `--platform` must match it. If your agent is
connected to PagerDuty instead, match PagerDuty priorities:

```bash
az sre response-plan create -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" \
  --name p1-pagerduty --platform PagerDuty --subagent incident-responder \
  --priority P1 P2 --mode review
```

Check the plans. The portal shows them on Triggers & response plans and as trigger nodes on
Agent Canvas:

```bash
az sre response-plan list -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" -o table
az sre response-plan show -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" --name sev1-checkout
```

### Change a response plan

| Step | Label | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Change severities, mode or other settings | CLI | `az sre response-plan update`. A list flag such as `--priority` replaces the whole list. |
| Turn a plan off and on | CLI | `az sre response-plan disable`, `az sre response-plan enable` |
| Delete a plan | CLI | `az sre response-plan delete -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" --name sev1-checkout --yes` when you no longer need it. Check the exact name first with `az sre response-plan list`. |

```bash
az sre response-plan update -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" \
  --name sev1-checkout --priority Sev0 Sev1 Sev2
az sre response-plan update -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" \
  --name sev1-checkout --mode autonomous

az sre response-plan disable -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" --name sev1-checkout
az sre response-plan enable -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" --name sev1-checkout
```

### Remove the quickstart plan

If you turned on the quickstart response plan while connecting a platform, it runs alongside
your own plans and can send incidents to the wrong subagent or process them twice. The portal
names it `quickstart_response_plan`, and `az sre response-plan list` and `create` warn when
it's there. Delete it from the CLI, or in the portal on Triggers & response plans:

```bash
az sre response-plan delete -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" \
  --name quickstart_response_plan --yes
```

### When an incident arrives

| Step | Label | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Watch the agent investigate and read its findings | Portal | Incidents (`/views/incidents`), then the incident's thread. `az sre` can't list incidents or threads. |

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Incident platform 'AzMonitor' does not match configured incident management type 'None'` | The agent has no incident platform (`'None'`), or `--platform` doesn't match the one it has. | Set the platform as above, or pass the agent's platform in `--platform`. |
| `One or more configured handling agents do not exist.` | `--subagent` names a subagent that doesn't exist. | Check the name with `az sre subagent list -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT"`. |
| `The extension configuration is invalid.` with no reason | Azure doesn't say why, and the CLI can't ask the agent's own API because you have no SRE Agent role. | Give yourself an SRE Agent role, see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites), and run the command again. The error then names the cause. |
| `Forbidden(Forbidden: Access denied by PDP)` | You have no SRE Agent role on the agent. | `az sre access grant -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" --role admin --assignee-me`, then wait about 30 seconds. |
| `(InvalidApplicationInsightsConfiguration) The AppId and ConnectionString fields must be provided together.` from `agent update` | The agent is linked to Application Insights, and the update sent the link without its connection string, which Azure never returns. | Add the same `--log-configuration` to the command, such as `--log-configuration "@log-configuration.json"`. |
| "Response plan '...' was created, but its instructions were not saved" | The match rules were saved, then the instructions write to the agent's API failed. | Fix the access problem, then run `az sre response-plan update` with only `--instructions` or `--processing-guide`. |

## Get started

These are the pages under Get started in the Learn table of contents, in order.

### Evaluate SRE Agent

Learn: [Evaluate SRE Agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sre-agent/evaluate).
**Summary:** CLI, except the evaluation ideas that need the agent's chat or the portal.

| Step | Label | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Check that a model provider is available in your region | CLI | `az sre agent list-models --location eastus2` |
| Create one agent for one service | CLI | See [Create and set up](#create-and-set-up). |
| Investigate a root cause | Portal | New chat (`/views/thread/new`). |
| Automate alert response | Portal, then CLI | See [Step 4](#step-4-set-up-incident-response). |
| Automate workflows with an HTTP trigger or a scheduled health check | CLI | See [Create an HTTP trigger](#create-an-http-trigger) and [Create scheduled tasks](#create-scheduled-tasks). |
| Automate workflows with a query trigger | Portal | Automation (`/views/automation`). `az sre` has no query triggers. |
| Track usage | CLI | `az sre usage list -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" --daily true`. Portal: Agent consumption (`/views/monitor/agentConsumption`). |
| When the trial ends, delete the agent to stop the always-on charge | CLI | `az sre agent delete -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT"`. Portal: Settings > General > Delete SRE Agent. |

### Create and set up

Learn: [Create and set up Azure SRE Agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sre-agent/create-and-set-up),
the first step of Get started. Learn's Create an agent page points here.
**Summary:** CLI, except Log Analytics and Application Insights logs, GitHub App and GitLab code
connections, and resource-group permission levels.

| Step | Label | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open the wizard and fill in Basics: subscription, resource group, name, region, model provider | CLI | Commands below. |
| Basics: Application Insights, Create new | CLI | Create a Log Analytics workspace and Application Insights, then link Application Insights with `--log-configuration`, below. Without it the agent works, but has no trace view. |
| Review and Deploy | CLI | `az sre agent create`. Like the wizard, it also creates a user-assigned identity. |
| Deploy: make you SRE Agent Administrator | CLI | `--grant-access-to-me admin` |
| Open Set up your agent | Portal | Opens after deployment. Each card is a row below. |
| Code: GitHub with your account or a PAT | CLI | `az sre repo connect -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" --repo-url "https://github.com/<org>/<repo>"`. It shows a one-time code and opens GitHub's sign-in page in your browser. To use a PAT instead, set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to it first. |
| Code: Azure DevOps with your account or a managed identity | CLI | `az sre repo connect -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" --repo-url "https://dev.azure.com/<org>/<project>/_git/<repo>"`. The CLI creates a PAT from your sign-in; for a managed identity, add `--devops-auth-type managed-identity --devops-identity <identity-resource-id>`. |
| Code: GitHub App or GitLab | Portal | Code access (`/views/context/codeAccess`). `az sre repo connect` supports GitHub and Azure DevOps tokens and managed identities only. |
| Logs: Azure Data Explorer | CLI | See [Set up Kusto connector](#set-up-kusto-connector). |
| Logs: Log Analytics Workspace or Application Insights | Portal | Connectors (`/views/extensions/connectors`). The wizard also assigns Log Analytics Reader and Monitoring Reader on the resource group and adds it to managed resources. |
| Logs: other providers, such as Datadog or Splunk | Portal | Connectors. |
| Ask "Check for any errors in the last 24 hours" | Portal | New chat. |
| Azure resources: a subscription or management group | CLI | `az sre managed-resource grant -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" --target-subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID"`, or `--management-group <group>`. It assigns the same roles as the portal, but the scope isn't listed on the Managed resources page. |
| Azure resources: a resource group with Reader or Privileged permissions | Portal | Managed resources (`/views/context/managedResourcesGroups`). The portal assigns roles based on the resource types in the group; `--target-resource-group` assigns only Reader and Monitoring Contributor. |
| Done and go to agent | Portal | Agent home (`$PORTAL`). |

Create the resource group and the agent. List the models first if you're not sure your region
supports the provider:

```bash
az group create --name "$RG" --location eastus2
az sre agent list-models --location eastus2

az sre agent create -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" --location eastus2 \
  --default-model "{provider:anthropic,name:automatic}" \
  --grant-access-to-me admin
```

To link Application Insights, as the wizard's Create new option does, create a Log Analytics
workspace and Application Insights in the agent's resource group. Pass `--workspace`: without
it, Azure creates a managed workspace in a separate resource group. The `az monitor app-insights`
commands come from the `application-insights` extension, which the CLI offers to install the
first time. Then pass the app ID and connection string in a file, because the connection string
contains characters that inline values can't hold:

```bash
az monitor log-analytics workspace create -g "$RG" --workspace-name "$AGENT-logs" --location eastus2
az monitor app-insights component create -g "$RG" --app "$AGENT-insights" --location eastus2 \
  --workspace "$AGENT-logs"

APP_ID="$(az monitor app-insights component show -g "$RG" --app "$AGENT-insights" --query appId -o tsv)"
CONNECTION_STRING="$(az monitor app-insights component show -g "$RG" --app "$AGENT-insights" --query connectionString -o tsv)"
cat > log-configuration.json <<JSON
{"application-insights-configuration": {"app-id": "$APP_ID", "connection-string": "$CONNECTION_STRING"}}
JSON

az sre agent create -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" --location eastus2 \
  --log-configuration "@log-configuration.json" --grant-access-to-me admin
```

Keep `log-configuration.json`. Later `az sre agent update` commands on a linked agent need the
same `--log-configuration`; see [Connect your incident platform](#connect-your-incident-platform).

### Team onboarding

Learn: [Team onboarding](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sre-agent/team-onboard).
**Summary:** Portal. The whole step happens in the agent's chat.

| Confirm connectors, knowledge files and Azure resources | CLI | `az sre connector list -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT"`, `az sre knowledge list -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT"`, `az sre managed-resource list -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT"` |
| Confirm code repositories and the Indexed status of knowledge files | Portal | Code access and Knowledge sources. `az sre` can't list repositories. |
| Ask a question only the new source can answer | Portal | New chat. |
| Return to the Team onboarding thread | Portal | Favorites > Team onboarding. |

### Run your first investigation

Learn: [Run your first investigation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sre-agent/first-investigation).
**Summary:** Portal.

| Step | Label | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start a new chat and describe the problem | Portal | New chat (`/views/thread/new`). |
| Watch the agent work and read the diagnosis | Portal | The chat thread. |

### Automate incident response

Learn: [Automate incident response](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sre-agent/automate-incidents).
**Summary:** the same flow as [Step 4](#step-4-set-up-incident-response).

| Step | Label | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connect Azure Monitor | CLI | See [Connect your incident platform](#connect-your-incident-platform). |
| Connect PagerDuty or ServiceNow instead | Portal | See [Connect your incident platform](#connect-your-incident-platform). |

| Preview matching alerts | Portal | Triggers & response plans (`/views/incidents/triggersAndResponsePlans`). |
| Check that the plan is On and in Review mode | CLI | `az sre response-plan list -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" -o table` |
| Watch the investigation when an alert fires | Portal | Incidents (`/views/incidents`). |

### Automate workflows

Learn: [Automate workflows](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sre-agent/automate-workflows).
**Summary:** Portal, then CLI. The Outlook connector needs the portal. The custom agent and the
scheduled task work from the CLI.

| Step | Label | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add the Office 365 Outlook connector, sign in, set the send operation to Ask and lock the recipient | Portal | Connectors > Add connector > Notification. |
| Create the custom agent with its instructions | CLI | `az sre subagent create`, below. |
| Give the custom agent the connector's email tool | Portal | Agent Canvas, edit the agent > Choose tools. The tool comes from a connector the CLI can't create. |
| Schedule a recurring task | CLI | `az sre automation scheduled-task create`, below. |
| Run the task now and check the run | Portal | Automation (`/views/automation`). `az sre automation scheduled-task show` shows the task definition. |
| Turn off the task | Portal | Automation > Turn off. |
| Delete the task | CLI | `az sre automation scheduled-task delete -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" --name daily-health-report --yes` |
| Remove the connector | Portal | Connectors. |
| Revoke the Outlook sign-in | External | Your Microsoft account's app permissions. |

```bash
cat > health-check-reporter.json <<'JSON'
{
  "instructions": "You are a health check reporter. Check Azure resource health for my container apps and email the summary to ops@example.com.",
  "handoffDescription": "Use for scheduled health reports on the container apps."
}
JSON

az sre subagent create -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" \
  --name health-check-reporter --value "@health-check-reporter.json"

az sre automation scheduled-task create -g "$RG" --agent-name "$AGENT" \
  --name daily-health-report \
  --value '{"cronExpression": "0 8 * * *", "agent": "health-check-reporter", "agentPrompt": "Check the health of the resources in my resource group. Verify all apps are running, check CPU and memory metrics over the last hour, and review any recent warning logs. Summarize findings and send the report."}'
```

`cronExpression` is in UTC. The portal's Time of day field shows your browser's time zone, but
it also saves the schedule in UTC.
